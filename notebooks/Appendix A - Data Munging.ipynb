    "There are a wide variety of ways to obtain data: web scraping, APIs, Excel files, and databases. These notes do not pretend to be comprehensive. There are likely to be many special cases. However, they do point you to resources for many of the basic data munging tasks and how to accomplish them in Python. These include:\n",

    "Of course, you need to do something with the data in between the steps for it to be meaningful.\n",
